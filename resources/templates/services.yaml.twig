# The services.yaml file defines what other services will be part of your cluster,
# such as a database or caching server. The keys are the name of the service, which
# you will reference in the .platform.app.yaml relationships section. The type specifies the
# service and its version. In some cases a disk key is also available and indicates
# the size in megabytes to reserve for that service's storage. You may also have
# more than one service of a given type, as long as they have unique names.
#
# See https://docs.platform.sh/user_guide/reference/services-yaml.html for more information.

# Example MySQL service
#
# mysqldb:
#     type: mysql:5.5
#     disk: 2048
