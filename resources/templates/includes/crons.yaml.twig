# Cron jobs allow you to run scheduled tasks at specified times or intervals.
#
# The minimum interval between cron runs is 5 minutes, even if specified as
# less. Additionally, a variable delay is added to each cron job in each project
# in order to prevent host overloading should every project try to run their
# nightly tasks at the same time. Your crons will not run exactly at the time
# that you specify, but will be delayed by 0-300 seconds.
