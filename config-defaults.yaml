## CLI configuration: default values.
##
## The default values are overridden by:
## 1. config.yaml in the CLI repository, or CLI_CONFIG_FILE if defined
## 2. A user-specific config.yaml file inside the {application.user_config_dir}.
## 3. Environment variables.
##    Some specific keys have assigned environment variables that can be used
##    to override them (see comments). In addition, all scalar values already
##    defined at the second level can be overridden by an environment variable
##    named like {application.env_prefix}SECTION_KEY, for example
##    CLI_APPLICATION_NAME.
##
## Please note that overriding configuration locally can make future updates
## and support more complex.
