The CLI will work with the old file structure, and there is a migration tool ('platform legacy-migrate') for updating to the new structure.\n\n* The web root has changed location from 'www' to '_www', to avoid conflicts with actual project files in the repo.\n\n* The CLI now requires PHP version 5.5.9 (minimum) due to updated dependencies.\n\nVersion 3.x.x also comes with many other smaller improvements and bug fixes.",

This reduces downtime, at the risk of backing up data in an\n  inconsistent state.\n  N.B. This will only work for more recent versions of our orchestration\n  software. Upgrades are mostly taking place this week.\n\n* Add `--state` and `--result` filters to activity commands.\n  Possible states: `in_progress`, `pending`, `complete`, or `cancelled`.\n  Possible results: `success` or `failure`.\n  N.B. The `--result` filter cannot be combined with others at this time.\n\n* Add an `activity:cancel` command, which will allow cancelling pending\n  activities, and stopping crons that are in progress.\n\n* SSH error handling improvements:\n  - Recommend an SSH certificate if not present after an authentication error.\n  - Avoid making a test connection where not necessary.\n  - Check for host key authentication errors, and suggest remedies for CI scripts.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* Remove hardcoded instances of \"master\" as the default branch name.\n* Show a loading message on environments and project lists.",

They will in a future version. The API is backwards\ncompatible: if your project supports environment types, and you change a user's\nrole on an environment, it will change their role on all environments of that\ntype.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* Support new `/users/me` API in the `auth:info` command.\n* Fix `user:update` to avoid recalculating environment access changes while they are made.",
