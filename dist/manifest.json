In version 3.x.x, this is no longer the case: the CLI operates directly inside your project's Git repository. The CLI will work with the old file structure, and there is a migration tool ('platform legacy-migrate') for updating to the new structure.\n\n* The web root has changed location from 'www' to '_www', to avoid conflicts with actual project files in the repo.\n\n* The CLI now requires PHP version 5.5.9 (minimum) due to updated dependencies.\n\nVersion 3.x.x also comes with many other smaller improvements and bug fixes.",
