However, it has a new installation method which no\nlonger requires PHP; it embeds the Legacy CLI and a PHP runtime as part of the\nsame binary.\n\nThe Legacy CLI will now prompt to install the new one, when appropriate. A\nnotice will be displayed if both CLIs are installed, with a suggestion to\ndelete the Legacy one.\n\nThe new CLI's version number will track the Legacy version that it wraps; in\nother words version numbers will be synchronized.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* Update ssh-key commands:\n  - Use `ed25519` instead of `rsa` by default.\n  - Recommend SSH certificates instead of keys.\n  - Otherwise, use ed25519 instead of rsa by default.\n  - Support interactive selection in ssh-key:delete.\n* Allow the `disk` command to be used during crons/deployments.\n* Always print the selected project/environment in verbose mode.\n* Fix wildcard matching for `environment:delete`.\n* Support wildcards when filtering by activity type.\n* Describe which columns are available in help for the `--columns` option\n  (affects commands that list data).\n* Re-fetch the activity log to ensure log items are not missed.\n* Fix \"Cannot cast a filtered stream\" error (on PHP 7.4+).\n* Reduce blank lines from shell commands in verbose mode.\n* Update library `giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php` from 8.13.1 to 8.13.3.",

See the command help for more information.\n* The default interval is now 1/5th of the default range instead of 1/10th. By\n  default, the range is 10min, so the interval is now 2min instead of 1min.\n\n## Other changes\n\n* Add an `--update` option to `var:create` (update if the variable exists).\n* Fix validation of `--format` when used with `-h`.\n  This also marks the `xml` help format as deprecated, and explains when the\n  simplexml extension is not installed.\n* Changes to `-vv` and `-vvv` logging:\n  - Only print exception traces in debug mode\n  - Avoid printing the same exception message twice\n  - Print Guzzle request and response summaries in very-verbose mode\n  - Turn off cURL debugging entirely, as it is somewhat uncontrollable, and the\n    debug output may be copied and pasted without realising the consequences\n    (some headers contain private information, in particular Authorization).\n  - Avoid ProgressMessage overwriting previous lines in very-verbose mode\n  - Only print shell commands in very-verbose mode\n  - Only print extra shell command info in debug mode\n  - Prefix shell command info with # and HTTP requests with > or < symbols\n  - Print a debug message when loading from cache.\n  - Improve output of selected environment (avoid printing twice).\n* Fix path column in `apps` command.\n* Warn when verbose mode is enabled in `:curl` commands.\n* Preload `ConsoleTerminateEvent` before forking in `tunnel:open`.\n* Fix error in `tunnel:open` when tunnels are already open.\n* Show beta commands in the command list.\n* Prefer the production environment over the default branch, when selecting a\n  default environment.\n* Support '*' as a wildcard character.\n  Different characters are convenient in different shells depending whether they\n  need quoting.
