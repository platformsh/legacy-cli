The **Platform.sh CLI** is the official command-line interface for [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh). Use this tool to interact with your [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) projects, and to build them locally for development purposes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli)

Alternative README versions: [`master`](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/blob/master/README.md),   [`1.x`](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/blob/1.x/README.md)

### Requirements

* Operating system: Linux, OS X, Windows Vista, Windows 7 (any), or Windows 8 Pro (Win8 Standard does not work due to an issue with symlink permissions)
* PHP 5.4.0 or higher, with cURL support
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) (only needed for Drupal projects)

### Installation

* [Install Composer globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

* Install the latest stable version of the CLI:

        composer global require platformsh/cli:@stable

* Make sure Composer's `vendor/bin` directory is in your system's PATH.

  In Linux or OS X, add this line to your [shell configuration
  file](#shell-configuration-file):

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"

  In Windows, you can use this command from a Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

        setx PATH "%PATH%;%APPDATA%\Composer\vendor\bin"

  Start a new shell before continuing.

* Enable auto-completion and shell aliases (optional, but recommended).

  In Linux or OS X, add this line to your [shell configuration
  file](#shell-configuration-file):

        . "$HOME/.composer/vendor/platformsh/cli/platform.rc" 2>/dev/null

  In Windows, it would be:

        . "$APPDATA/Composer/vendor/platformsh/cli/platform.rc" 2> nul

#### Shell configuration file
Your 'shell configuration file' might be in any of the following
locations:

* `~/.bashrc` (common in Linux)
* `~/.bash_profile` (common in OS X)
* `~/.zshrc` (if using ZSH)

Start a new shell or type `source <filename>` to load the new configuration.

### Updating

New releases of the CLI are made regularly. Update with this command:

    composer global update

### Usage

You can run the Platform.sh CLI in your shell by typing `platform`.

        platform

Use the 'list' command to get a list of available options and commands:

        platform list

### Commands

The current output of `platform list` is as follows:

```

### Known issues

#### Caching
The CLI caches details of your projects and their environments. These caches
could become out-of-date. You can get a fresh list of projects or environments
with the `platform projects` and `platform environments` commands.

### Customization

You can configure the CLI via these environment variables:

* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_API_TOKEN`: an API token to use for all requests
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DEBUG`: set to 1 to enable cURL debugging
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DISABLE_CACHE`: set to 1 to disable caching
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DRUSH`: configure the Drush executable to use (default 'drush')
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_ENVIRONMENTS_TTL`: the cache TTL for environments, in seconds (default 600)
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_PROJECTS_TTL`: the cache TTL for projects, in seconds (default 3600)
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_SESSION_ID`: change user (default 'default')
* `http_proxy` or `https_proxy`: specify a proxy for connecting to Platform.sh
