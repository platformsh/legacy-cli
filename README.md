The **Platform.sh CLI** is the official command-line interface for [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh). Use this tool to interact with your [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) projects, and to build them locally for development purposes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli)

### Requirements

* Operating system: Linux, OS X, Windows Vista, Windows 7 (any), or Windows 8 Pro (Win8 Standard does not work due to an issue with symlink permissions)
* PHP 5.4.0 or higher, with cURL support
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) (only needed for Drupal projects)

### Installation

* [Install Composer globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

* Install the latest stable version of the CLI:

        composer global require 'platformsh/cli:@stable'

* Make sure Composer's `vendor/bin` directory is in your system's PATH.

  In Linux or OS X, add this line to your [shell configuration file](#shell-configuration-file):

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"

  In Windows, use this command from a Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

        setx PATH "%PATH%;%APPDATA%\Composer\vendor\bin"

  Start a new shell before continuing.

* Optionally, enable auto-completion. Add these lines to your [shell
  configuration file](#shell-configuration-file):

        # Platform.sh CLI configuration
        PLATFORMSH_CONF=~/.composer/vendor/platformsh/cli/platform.rc
        [ -f "$PLATFORMSH_CONF" ] && . "$PLATFORMSH_CONF"

#### Shell configuration file
Your 'shell configuration file' might be in any of the following
locations:

* `~/.bashrc` (common in Linux)
* `~/.bash_profile` (common in OS X)
* `~/.zshrc` (if using ZSH)

Start a new shell or type `source <filename>` to load the new configuration.

### Updating

New releases of the CLI are made regularly. You can update with the same Composer command:

    composer global require 'platformsh/cli:@stable'

### Usage

You can run the Platform.sh CLI in your shell by typing `platform`.

        platform

Use the 'list' command to get a list of available options and commands:

        platform list

### Commands

The current output of `platform list` is as follows:

```

### Known issues

#### Caching
The CLI caches details of your projects and their environments. These caches
could become out-of-date. You can get a fresh list of projects or environments
with the `platform projects` and `platform environments` commands.
