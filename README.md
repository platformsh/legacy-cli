The **Platform.sh CLI** is the official command-line interface for [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh). Use this tool to interact with your [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) projects, and to build them locally for development purposes.

## Requirements

* Operating system: Linux, OS X, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 10 (Windows 8 Standard does not work due to an issue with symlink permissions)
* PHP 5.5.9 or higher, with cURL support
* Git
* For building locally, your project's dependencies, e.g.
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (for many PHP projects)
  * [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) (for Drupal projects)

## Installation

### Installing on OS X or Linux

This is the recommended installation method. Simply use this command:

    curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php

### Installing manually

1. Download the latest stable package from the
  [Releases page](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/releases)
  (look for the latest `platform.phar` file).

2. Rename the file to `platform`, ensure it is executable, and move it into a
  directory in your PATH (use `echo $PATH` to see your options).

3. Enable autocompletion and shell aliases:

        platform self:install

## Updating

New releases of the CLI are made regularly. Update with this command:

    platform self:update

## Usage

You can run the Platform.sh CLI in your shell by typing `platform`.

    platform

Use the 'list' command to get a list of available options and commands:

    platform list

### Commands

The current output of `platform list` is as follows:

## Known issues

### Caching

The CLI caches details of your projects and their environments, and some other
information. These caches could become out-of-date. You can clear caches with
the command `platform clear-cache` (or `platform cc` for short).

## Customization

You can configure the CLI via the user configuration file `~/.platformsh/config.yaml`:

```yaml
api:
  # A path (relative or absolute) to a file containing an API token.
  # Run 'platform logout --all' if you change this value.
  token_file: null

local:
  # Set this to true to avoid some Windows symlink issues.
  copy_on_windows: false

  # Configure the Drush executable to use (defaults to 'drush').
  drush_executable: null

updates:
  # Whether to check for automatic updates.
  check: true

  # The interval between checking for updates (seconds).
  check_interval: 86400
```

Other customization is available via environment variables:

* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DEBUG`: set to 1 to enable cURL debugging
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DISABLE_CACHE`: set to 1 to disable caching
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_SESSION_ID`: change user session (default 'default')
* `http_proxy` or `https_proxy`: specify a proxy for connecting to Platform.sh
