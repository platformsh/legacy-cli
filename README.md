The **Platform.sh CLI** is the official command-line interface for [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh). Use this tool to interact with your [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) projects, and to build them locally for development purposes.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/platformsh/platformsh-cli) [![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/platformsh/cli/v/stable)](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/releases) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/platformsh/cli/license)](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Requirements

* Operating system: Linux, OS X, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 Pro, or Windows 10 (Windows 8 Standard does not work due to an issue with symlink permissions)
* PHP 5.5 or higher, with cURL support
* For building locally, your project's dependencies, e.g.
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (for many PHP projects)
  * [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) (for Drupal projects)

## Installation

### Installing on OS X or Linux

Simply use this command:

    curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php

### Installing on Windows

1. Install Composer using [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows).

2. Install the CLI, in your preferred terminal application (e.g. in Git Bash):

        composer global require platformsh/cli:@stable

3. Make sure the Composer `vendor/bin` directory is in your PATH. Use this
  command from a Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

        setx PATH "%PATH%;%APPDATA%\Composer\vendor\bin"

  Start a new terminal before continuing.

### Installing manually

Installing manually is not recommended, unless you are confident you know what
you are doing.

1. Download the latest stable package from the
  [Releases page](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli/releases)
  (look for the latest `platform.phar` file).

2. Rename the file to `platform`, ensure it is executable, and move it into a
  directory in your PATH (use `echo $PATH` to see your options).

3. Enable autocompletion and shell aliases:

        platform self:install

## Updating

New releases of the CLI are made regularly. Update with this command:

    platform self:update

## Usage

You can run the Platform.sh CLI in your shell by typing `platform`.

    platform

Use the 'list' command to get a list of available options and commands:

    platform list

### Commands

The current output of `platform list` is as follows:

```

## Known issues

### Caching

The CLI caches details of your projects and their environments, and some other
information. These caches could become out-of-date. You can clear caches with
the command `platform clear-cache` (or `platform cc` for short).

## Customization

You can configure the CLI via these environment variables:

* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_API_TOKEN`: an API token to use for all requests
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_COPY_ON_WINDOWS`: set to 1 to avoid some Windows symlink issues
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DEBUG`: set to 1 to enable cURL debugging
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DISABLE_CACHE`: set to 1 to disable caching
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_DRUSH`: configure the Drush executable to use (default 'drush')
* `PLATFORMSH_CLI_SESSION_ID`: change user session (default 'default')
* `http_proxy` or `https_proxy`: specify a proxy for connecting to Platform.sh
